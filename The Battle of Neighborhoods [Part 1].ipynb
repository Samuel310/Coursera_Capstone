    "This Project would be helpful for many people to take a better decision on choosing the best neighborhood out of many neighborhoods to build/open their restaurants in Brooklyn, New York City based on the distribution of various different restaurants in and around that neighborhood. Therefore, this project would compare various restaurants and other locations in that neighborhoods and analyses the top 10 most common venues to open a restaurant. Also, this project uses K-mean clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster the venues based on the place category such as restaurants and other locations.\n",
